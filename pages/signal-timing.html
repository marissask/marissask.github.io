                    <span class="proj-desc signal-desc">
                        <p>Myself, along with three other members, were assigned to calculate an improved signal timing design for the high-traffic signalized intersection between Mowry Rd. and Gale Lemerand Dr. on the University of Florida campus. In doing so, we were to account for the existing lane groups and signal configuration along with recorded values for peak-volume traffic and signal timing-- all of which were measured at the site. From there, we also determined and compared the level of service (LOS) at the intersection between the current signal timing and our recommended signal timing, and found that the LOS had improved from D to C.</p>
